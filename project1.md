### [Interface Programming II - Projects](https://github.com/simplesessions/kcc-nma-art258-projects/blob/master/README.md)

# Project 1: Flexing Your Muscles

## Brief

You'll be using what we learned from class so far to create a one-page website. The theme of the website is going to be some kind of product or service that you want to sell.

Examples:

- [http://mediaqueri.es/](http://mediaqueri.es/)
- [https://onepagelove.com](https://onepagelove.com)
- [https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?categories=55](https://www.siteinspire.com/websites?categories=55)
- [http://www.webdesign-inspiration.com/web-designs/type/product?page=1](http://www.webdesign-inspiration.com/web-designs/type/product?page=1)
- [https://www.warbyparker.com/](https://www.warbyparker.com/)
- [http://sandwichvideo.com](http://sandwichvideo.com)

## Requirements

- At least one breakpoint that makes this site usable within a mobile context.
- Use flexbox in some capacity to lay out your site.

## Getting Started

- Fork the [starter repo project](https://github.com/simplesessions/kcc-nma-art258-starter) on github.com (not your desktop GitHub client).
- Rename the project "kcc-nma-art258-project-X" where X is the number of the project.
- After forking the project, make sure you're in the "plain" branch until we're used to using Gulp.
- Open up the GitHub Desktop Client and clone your repository.
- __IMPORTANT!!!__ Create a new branch from the project called "gh-pages". ([more on Creating Branches in GitHub Desktop](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/creating-a-branch-for-your-work/))
- Go ahead and start working.

## Working on Your Project

We will be using [Atom](https://atom.io), a free text-editor.

While working on your project in Atom, after making a changes (or several, related changes) to your code, check the GitHub Desktop app. It'll show you the code that's changed since you last made any changes. When you've completed some goal or task with your project, be sure to commit the code within GitHub Desktop.

When you commit code, it's like you're locally saving the changes that you made since you last committed. When you've made several commits, be sure to hit the __publish__ button in the upper right to __push__ your code to GitHub.

## Due Date & How to Hand This In

This project will be due by the beginning of class on Thursday, September 15.

Simply committing then publishing your code to the repo will be "turning it in", as your page will show up at http://_username_.github.io/_project-name_. Note that you can publish your code as many times as you want – this is how Git works. You basically just keep making changes to your code, then publish it to GitHub in order to save your work.

## Other Notes

### GitHub for Noobs

As this is the first time we're utilizing Git and GitHub in class, here is a pretty good series on understanding how they work, as well as how to utilize the GitHub Desktop client.

_Note: There is a 4th episode to the series that talks about using Git on the command line, which we won't be doing in this class. However, feel free to watch the video on YouTube, which will show in the sidebar after clicking any of the above links._
