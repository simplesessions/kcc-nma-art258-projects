# THE FINAL

Congratulations! You've made it all the way to the end. For our final project, you'll be working with something familiar...

## The Project

3-page website, product-focused:

- Home page, which gives a general overview of your product
- A ‚ÄúHow it works‚Äù page, which gives you the gist of how your product works. In cases where your product is less technical, this could alternatively be a ‚Äúdeep-dive‚Äù into knowing more about your product. For instance, if this is a food product, it could be something like ‚ÄúHow is it made?‚Äù (See me if you have any questions)
- Wildcard page - this could be any one of the following:
    - Help page
    - FAQ
    - About your Company
    - How to Use
    - More on your product description. Examples:
        - Technical Specifications
        - Other variations

## Requirements

- All colors and fonts must be made variables. Dimensional/size values (pixels, rems, ems, etc.) can also be variables, but won‚Äôt be graded against.
- No CSS within your style.scss file - only imports.
- Must utilize at least three JavaScript libraries in order to create your page.
- Must use flexbox in your overall layouts.
- Must utilize Google Fonts.
- Must utilize at least four media queries, and have layouts that work correctly from a size of 320px to at least 1200px and above.
- An appeal to the user to buy/use your product (call to action).
- Make use of CSS transitions.
- For the areas that explain about the product, they must have more than a line of text describing the product. Although this is a coding class, this is meant to also challenge layout changes with varying text.

## Grading

- 20% - Fully-functioning website. This means no errors in the console, all images must load, and the layout must not seem "broken" (no unintentional scrollbars, no links floating in limbo, etc.)
- 30% - CSS (and Sass) - See above for the requirements specific requirements. Your CSS must all work, and I should be able to compile your Sass from the src folder.
- 30% - JavaScript - See above for the requirements specific requirements. Your JS must all work, and I should be able to compile your JS from the src folder and have everything work with no errors.
- 20% - HTML - your HTML should be nested correctly (with a little wiggle room for indentation differences). You should also stay away from bad naming practices when naming your classes.

## Getting Started

- Download the starter project from https://github.com/simplesessions/kcc-nma-art258-starter
- Rename the project to "art258-final"
- Use GitHub to create a new repo from this project named "art258-final"
- Push/sync your changes to your GitHub account

## Turning In Your Project

I will consider all commits made until midnight of December 14th, 2016 (technically 12:00am of December 15th, 2016). Simply make sure all your changes are committed to your repo by then. When you're finished, even if early, send me an email to let me know when you're done.

Then party üéâüéâüéâ
