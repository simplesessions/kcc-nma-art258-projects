# THE FINAL

Congratulations! You've made it all the way to the end. For our final project, you'll be working with something familiar...

## The Project

3-page website, product-focused:

- Home page, which gives a general overview of your product
- A “How it works” page, which gives you the gist of how your product works. In cases where your product is less technical, this could alternatively be a “deep-dive” into knowing more about your product. For instance, if this is a food product, it could be something like “How is it made?” (See me if you have any questions)
- Wildcard page - this could be any one of the following:
    - Help page
    - FAQ
    - About your Company
    - How to Use
    - More on your product description. Examples:
        - Technical Specifications
        - Other variations

## Requirements

- All colors and fonts must be made variables. Dimensional/size values (pixels, rems, ems, etc.) can also be variables, but won’t be graded against.
- No CSS within your style.scss file - only imports.
- Must utilize at least three JavaScript libraries in order to create your page.
- Must use flexbox in your overall layouts.
- Must utilize Google Fonts.
- Must utilize at least four media queries, and have layouts that work correctly from a size of 320px to at least 1200px and above.
- An appeal to the user to buy/use your product (call to action).
- Make use of CSS transitions.
- For the areas that explain about the project, they must have more than a line of text describing the project. Although this is a coding class, this is meant to also challenge layout changes with varying text.

## Grading

- 20% - Fully-functioning website. This means no errors in the console, all images must load, and the layout must not seem "broken" (no unintentional scrollbars, no links floating in limbo, etc.)
- 30% - CSS (and Sass) - See above for the requirements specific requirements. Your CSS must all work, and I should be able to compile your Sass from the src folder.
- 30% - JavaScript - See above for the requirements specific requirements. Your JS must all work, and I should be able to compile your JS from the src folder and have everything work with no errors.
- 20% - HTML - your HTML should be nested correctly (with a little wiggle room for indentation differences). You should also stay away from bad naming practices when naming your classes.
